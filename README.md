# opennode_Arduino
In this repository you will find :
   * An idle firmware for all the type of arduino nodes.
   * An autotest firmware for all the types arudino nodes (the baudrate may vary between two different arduino board).

To open the file and compile the firmware, use the official arduino IDE.
The compilation is easy but to know were the binary file is created, you have to active the verbose mode in the arduino software (in the options) and watch the log.

It will then be possible to flash the binary file with avrdude.
