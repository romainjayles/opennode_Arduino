# opennode_Arduino
In this repository ou will find :
   * An idle firmware for all the arduino nodes.
   * An autotest firware for all the arudino nodes (the baudrate may vary between two different arduino).

To open the file and compile the file, use the official arduino IDE.
The compilation is easy but to see were the binary file is created, you have to active the verbose mode in the arduino software (in the options) and watch the log on the command in the terminal.
